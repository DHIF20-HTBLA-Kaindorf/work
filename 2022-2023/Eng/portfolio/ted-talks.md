### Talk Analysis

#### Talk 1

The first talk has the speaker talking about the value of communicating with a wide variety
of people, no matter if the share your view points. In fact, the speaker encourages talking to 
people who share very different opinions than as this will allow you develop your own ideas and 
ideologies. They also emphasize the importance of speaking with the intent to listen and not the 
intent to win an argument.

#### Talk 2

The second talk goes about how **reflection** can be the key factor that can improve your career. The
speaker states that building the habit of reflecting on ones actions with the intent to improve 
one's self is incredibly powerful. To strengthen their point, the speaker draws comparisons to professional 
sports teams and how they reflect on their games after they are finished to learn from them.

#### Talk 3

The third talk focuses on how to use your time more effectively by setting strict priorities. The 
speaker criticises trying to squeeze out more time out of a day becoming exceedingly effective at 
doing chores and instead mention how even very busy people can find time if they have a strong enough 
reason to do so. At the end of the talk they mention writing a letter to yourself about what will 
happened in the next year assuming that the next year was a great success and then setting priorities 
in order to get to the situation described in the letter. They also reiterates the importance of not 
only focussing on **careers* goals but also on *personal* and *relationship** goals.

#### Talk 4

The fourth talk discusses the fact that there is more to life than simply being happy. The speaker 
emphasises the importance of **meaning** in one's life. According to the speaker there are four core
pillars to meaning; **belonging*, *purpose*, *transcendence*, and *story telling**. Then they talk 
about the fact that people who are grounded by these pillars are able to fact tough life situations
head on.

#### Talk 5

The fifth talk is about how a person's story can affect the way they perceive their own life and 
the situations around them. They encourages critically thinking about your own stories and the stories
of other people and considering the other side of those stories, the other person or opinion that 
is not included in that story.

#### How the information was presented 

The trough line of all the talks was that every speaker seemed to have a strong desire to either
improve themselves or to show other people how to improve themselves. The speakers usually had a 
critical but caring attitude when addressing the status queue. They realise that it is not easy 
to change but that various changes are needed to improve one's self and society at large.

#### Personal Takeaway

Personally, I largely agree with the points the speakers made. The main point I will take away are 
is from talk three about active prioritisation. I think I can do quite a bit more without a massive 
investment setting clear goals for the future and then spending 30 minutes a week planning out 
how to spend the next week in a way to get closer to those goals. In summary I quite enjoyed the 
talks :)
